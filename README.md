# Team Version Control

For the purposes of this project I have followed a Git flow approach when working on this project
I have created the following branches ->
 - Main
 - develop -> This is used for developing the software component and I will create a pull request from this branch to main once the compoent has been developed and tested
 - develop_README -> There 5 topics the README.md will contain. I have broken these 5 topics into 5 different branches. Once the 5 topics have been covered I will create 5 pull requests and once the pull requests have been merged into develop_README I will ensure everything is up to standard and then finally create a pull request and merge both the software component from the develop branch and the README.md into the main branch and I will have completed the project.

The five branches that will be created from the develop_README branch are as follows ->
 - backlog_taskEstimation
 - testing_tdd
 - testCoverageMetric
 - teamVersionControl
 - codeReviewCheckList
All of te aboce branches have their own heading within the README.md file

### Benefits of following my approach to this project
 - Parallel Development. One of the great things about GitFlow is that it makes parallel development very easy, by isolating new development from finished work
 - Collaboration
 - Release Staging Area
 - Support For Emergency Fixes
