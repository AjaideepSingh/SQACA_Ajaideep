# Unit testing and Test-Driven development
I have followed a test driven development approach where the approach is broken into test cases are developed to specify and validate what the code will do.
[An example of a commit that follows a test driven development approach](https://github.com/AjaideepSingh/SQACA_Ajaideep/commit/a161b5942e0a8fd4ca358ef1b8973c30f6eedc22)
Within this commit I have created unit tests for all of the POJOs. The three POJOs I have tested are ->
 - Student Object
 - Topic Object
 - Rubric Object

In the POJO test cases I ensure that each Object is covered by a test. This is the ensure code correctness as in if the test is to pass the code logic is correct based on the dummy data I have provided in the unit tests.I will cover the gap closed by writing unit tests in terms of code coverage later on. You can note from the commit that the quality of the code is improved by following this approach. We can note that majority of the commits have supporting uniy test cases. Following this approach now will save project costs in the future.
