# Code review checklist
#### What is a code review?
A code review is a software quality assurance activity in which one or several people check a program mainly by viewing and reading parts of its source code, and they do so after implementation or as an interruption of implementation. At least one of the persons must not be the code's author.

#### What should a reviewer look for when reviewing a pull request
 - Does the code work? Check whether the function and logic are correct
 - Are functions, methods, and variables adequately named?
 - Is there supporting test cases that cover lines/methods of code?
 - Is the code legible?
 - Does the code meet company standards and guidelines?
 - Are there any bugs, smells, or grey areas?
 - Is there any performance issue?
